# optimizationPresentation

A presentation created with [manim](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) with the purpose to be an introduction to the [Vehicle Routing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem). 
Created for an internal company conference for Devoteam. 
Turned into a presentation from the manim files through [Manim Editor](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim_editor).

Main Requirements:
Python,
Manim,
Manim Editor,
Local Latex installation ( I used [MiKTex](https://miktex.org/)).


How to run: 
  
For each file: ``manim -pqh <path-to-file>.py -a --save_sections``
  
Then, start manim editor in the main project directory with: ``manedit``

Manim Editor will now start a local server which you can go to and order the compiled videos into a presentation.
